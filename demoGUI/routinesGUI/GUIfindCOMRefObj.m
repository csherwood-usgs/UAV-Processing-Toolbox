% given a gray shade image, I, find the intensities in a box defined by
% the center location, xyz, +/- dUV pixels using the center of mass (COM) .
% of a bright feature with intensities exceeding I=thresh.  
% The first ref obj is special and should be a bright object surrounded by 
% a large enough dark area to accommodate normal inter-frame movement 
% while still keeping the target in view.  The first point is location then
% is found to give a course correction to the guessed locations of the 
% later boxes.  If no bright pixels are found in the first ref point 
% search area, it is assumed that the aim point has changed dramatically,
% i.e. the data run is over.  In that case, fail = 1.

% Last update: KV WRL 04.2017
% - when the bounding box changes position from one frame to another, it could
%  go outside the image, generating an error. This has been fixed.
